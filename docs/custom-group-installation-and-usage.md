# Custom Group Installation and Usage

To get resource and cost visibility for a particular set of pods Purser allows user to create custom logical group.
User can define the label filter logic(`AND of ORs`: Conjunctive normal form) while creating the logical group i.e, pods satisfying these conditions will belong to this custom group.

## Installing logical group definition and an example logical group

To install the logical group definition into your cluster, 
download [purser-group-crd.yaml](../cluster/artifacts/purser-group-crd.yaml) yaml i.e,
```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: groups.vmware.purser.com
spec:
  group: vmware.purser.com
  names:
    kind: Group
    listKind: GroupList
    plural: groups
    singular: group
  scope: Namespaced
  version: v1
status:
  acceptedNames:
    kind: Group
    listKind: GroupList
    plural: groups
    singular: group
```
and use kubectl to install this definition
```bash
kubectl create -f purser-group-crd.yaml
```
_**NOTE:** This installation is needed only once per cluster_

**Installing an example logical group**

Download [example-group.yaml](../cluster/artifacts/example-group.yaml) yaml i.e,
```yaml
apiVersion: vmware.purser.com/v1
kind: Group
metadata:
  name: example-group
spec:
  name: example-group
  labels:
    expr1:
      app:
        - sample-app
        - sample-app2
      env:
        - dev
    expr2:
      namespace:
        - ns1
        - ns2
    expr3:
      key1:
        - val1
      key2:
        - val2
```
and use kubectl to create this logical group
```bash
kubectl create -f example-group.yaml
kubectl get groups.vmware.purser.com
```

This will create a custom logical group with name `example-group` of type `groups.vmware.purser.com`.
The label filter (used to fetch pods belonging to this group) for `example-group` will be
```yaml
(app=sampl-app OR app=sample-app2 OR env=dev) AND (namespace=ns1 OR namespace=ns2) AND (key1=val1 OR key2=val2)
```

In general the syntax purser supports is:

```
expr1 AND expr2 AND expr3 AND ...
where each expr is of form key1:value1 OR key2:value2 OR key1:value3 OR ...
```

## Usage
For resource and cost visibility into this newly created logical group run the following command
```bash
kubectl plugin purser get resources group example-group
```
_Refer [purser installation](../README.md#installation) to install purser controller and plugin_ 

## Uninstalling purser custom group
To uninstall purser custom group run the following command
```bash
kubectl delete -f purser-group-crd.yaml
```
where [purser-group-crd.yaml](../cluster/artifacts/purser-group-crd.yaml) is same file that you downloaded during installation.
