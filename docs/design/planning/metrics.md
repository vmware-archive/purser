# Metrics in Purser

## Introduction
This design document talks about the principles followed by purser to read metircs from a datastore. Before we discuss the solution, it is important to answer certain questions : 

1. Why metrics are important for purser ? 
2. What kinds of metrics does purser require to save/fetch ?
3. Why does purser need to be agnostic to the underlying metrics store ?

### Need for metrics

### Metrics kind & frequency

### Ability to be metric-store ignorant
